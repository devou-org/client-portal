# Password Reset Flow Documentation

## Overview
The password reset functionality now uses Firebase Authentication exclusively and includes proper email verification for registered users.

## Complete Flow

### 1. User Requests Password Reset
- User clicks "Forgot your password?" on login page
- Redirected to `/forgot-password` page
- User enters their registered email address

### 2. Email Verification Process
- **API Route**: `/api/reset-password`
- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Validates email format
  2. Checks if email exists in Firestore `users` collection
  3. If user not found, returns error message asking to contact administrator
  4. If user exists, sends Firebase password reset email to their Gmail

### 3. Firebase Email Sent
- Firebase sends password reset email directly to user's Gmail
- Email contains secure reset link with `oobCode` parameter
- Link directs to: `/reset-password?mode=resetPassword&oobCode=xxx`
- Link expires in 1 hour for security

### 4. Password Reset Page
- **Route**: `/reset-password`
- **Process**:
  1. Verifies the `oobCode` from URL parameters
  2. Displays email address for which password is being reset
  3. Shows password creation form with requirements
  4. Validates new password meets security requirements

### 5. Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Passwords must match (new + confirm)

### 6. Password Update & Redirect
- Firebase updates the password
- Success message displayed
- Automatic redirect to `/login` after 3 seconds
- User can now login with new password

## Security Features

### Email Verification
- Only registered users (in Firestore) can request reset
- Prevents unauthorized reset attempts
- Clear error messages for unregistered emails

### Firebase Security
- Secure reset codes generated by Firebase
- Links expire automatically
- Invalid/expired links handled gracefully

### Password Validation
- Strong password requirements enforced
- Real-time validation feedback
- Password visibility toggle for user convenience

## Error Handling

### API Errors
- Invalid email format
- User not found in database
- Firebase authentication errors
- Rate limiting for too many requests

### Reset Page Errors
- Invalid or expired reset codes
- Password requirement validation
- Network/Firebase connection issues

## User Experience

### Clear Instructions
- Step-by-step guidance throughout process
- Gmail-specific messaging for clarity
- Visual feedback with icons and colors

### Mobile Responsive
- Works on all device sizes
- Touch-friendly interface
- Accessible form controls

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed beyond existing Firebase config.

### Firebase Configuration
Uses existing Firebase Auth setup with:
- Password reset email templates
- Domain authorization
- Security rules

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid User Reset**: Register user → request reset → complete process
2. **Invalid Email**: Try reset with unregistered email
3. **Expired Link**: Use old reset link after expiration
4. **Weak Password**: Try password that doesn't meet requirements
5. **Password Mismatch**: Enter different passwords in new/confirm fields

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create test user account
2. Go to `/forgot-password`
3. Enter test user email
4. Check Gmail for reset email
5. Click reset link
6. Create new password
7. Verify redirect to login
8. Login with new password

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
- Custom email templates through Firebase
- Password strength meter
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Email notification when password is successfully changed
- Remember last successful login for security

### Analytics
- Track reset request frequency
- Monitor failed reset attempts
- User completion rates for reset flow
